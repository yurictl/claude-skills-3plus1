name: kb-search
description: Search a project's markdown knowledge base (docs/, README files, *.md) via the GitMark CLI — FTS5 ranking (bm25) plus trigram/fuzzy matching — instead of grepping across files. Use when you need to find where something is documented, "where do the docs say X", before reading files at random, or to generate an HTML overview/graph of the knowledge base. Handles substrings, typos, and non-Latin scripts.

# kb-search — knowledge-base search over a 3+1 docs tree

Search layer for markdown-in-git knowledge bases. Markdown is the source of truth;
the search index and HTML map are **derived** and regenerated from md (`.gitmark/`
is gitignored, never committed). The CLI is pure Python stdlib — offline, no deps.

In a 3+1 project this is the retrieval half: Orientation / Operations / Decisions
give the docs their shape; `gitmark` makes the grown-up tree findable without a
`grep`/`rg` fan-out.

Script: `~/.claude/skills/kb-search/scripts/gitmark.py`.

## When to use

- You need to find **where** something is documented → `gitmark search`, not a
  `grep`/`rg` fan-out. Results are `file:line · heading · snippet`.
- "How does X work here", "where are the docs for Y".
- Before reading files at random — locate the exact spots first.
- Want an overview/graph of the KB → `gitmark map`.

## Commands

```bash
G="python3 ~/.claude/skills/kb-search/scripts/gitmark.py"

$G index                 # (re)build .gitmark/index.db  (fast)
$G search "<query>"      # bm25 + trigram(substring) + fuzzy(3-gram); -k N, --json
$G map -o docs-map.html  # self-contained HTML: tree + rendered md + radial graph
$G serve -p 8799         # local http server to view the map
$G stat                  # files/chunks/links/index state
$G lint [paths…]         # ontology check (frontmatter/links/README/broken links)
$G version
```

## Workflow

1. If the index may be stale (docs changed) → `gitmark index`.
2. `gitmark search "<terms>"` — typos and morphology are tolerated (trigram/fuzzy).
   `[bm25]` = exact term, `[trigram]` = substring, `[fuzzy]` = n-gram (typos/forms).
3. Open the returned `file:line` and read the exact place.
4. `--json` for machine-readable results.

## Principles

- **Markdown is the source of truth.** Edit knowledge in `.md`, never the index.
- **Don't commit `.gitmark/`** — add it to the project's `.gitignore` on first index.
- Index is a cache — if results look stale, rebuild with `gitmark index --force`.
- Where knowledge *belongs* (which 3+1 bucket, when to promote it) is not this
  skill's job — that's `grill-me` routing and `graduate`.

## Origin

Vendored from [vakovalskii/ontoship](https://github.com/vakovalskii/ontoship)
(`skills/kb-search/gitmark.py`, MIT — see `LICENSE.upstream`). Local delta from
upstream: `.worktrees` added to `EXCLUDE_DIRS` so worktree copies don't produce
duplicate hits. Ontoship converges
on the same substrate bet — "a project knowledge base is just markdown + a README
index + git" — from the retrieval side; this skill plugs its search layer into the
3+1 loop unchanged.
