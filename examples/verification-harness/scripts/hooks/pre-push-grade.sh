# PreToolUse hook: gate `git push` behind a fresh /review grade when app/k8s/
# changed, and protect the harness itself from tampering.
#
# Contract (Claude Code hooks):
#   stdin  — JSON: {"tool_name": "...", "tool_input": {"command": "..."}, ...}
#   exit 0 — allow the tool call
#   exit 2 — block it; stderr is shown to the agent as the reason
#
# Three gates, in order:
#   1. Marker integrity — hand-editing .claude/grade-ok is blocked outright;
#      the only writer is scripts/grade-marker.sh (invoked by /review).
#   2. Weakened-test gate — a push that changes app/k8s/ AND the calibration
#      material (tests/golden/, the rubric) in one go is the classic
#      false-completion pattern; blocked, land them separately.
#   3. Grade freshness — the marker must exist and its fingerprint must match
#      the current app/k8s/ state (content-based, not mtime: `touch` can't
#      forge it, reverts invalidate it).
